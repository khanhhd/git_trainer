#How to start with Git ?
## Be a part of project.
1. You must clone project repository(repo) into your repo by click "Fork" button
in project repo.
2. Using Terminal to clone (download) project to local
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/khanhhd/git_trainer.git
```
3. Fetch and pull code from develop branch
```sh
$ cd git_trainer
$ git fetch
$ git pull origin
$ git checkout -b develop framgia/develop
```
## Controlling remote.
1. You must have 2 remote, 1 is to pull/push from/to your repo, 2 is to pull from project
repo (to get newest code).
Using command `$ git remote -v` to see current remote. There is only origin remote(origin is often 
use for naming your repo, you can set another name).
2. Adding remote for project repo (to get newest code)
```sh
$ git remote add framgia https://github.com/khanhhd/git_trainer.git
```
now, `$ git remote -v`, you will see 2 remote like this:
```sh
framgia https://github.com/khanhhd/git_trainer.git (fetch)
framgia https://github.com/khanhhd/git_trainer.git (push)
origin  https://github.com/kienbt01359/git_trainer.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/kienbt01359/git_trainer.git (push)
```
## Pull request
When you are assigned a task from redmine or something, you do it and you send pull request to reviewer to merge your code.
There are somethings you must do.
1. Get newest code from develop branch of project repo.
```sh
$ git checkout develop
$ git pull framgia develop
```
2. Checkout and switch new branch from develop branch
```sh
$ git checkout -b taskID
```
3. When you've done coding, requirement matched correctly, you will push to your taskID branch
```sh
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Name of task"
$ git push origin taskID
```
4. Go to your github's project repo. And send pull request to framgia/develop
5. If your code is OK, reviewers will merge, if not, they will adding some comments, and you must fix it again.
And then you will push it again.

This is called a cycle of pull-request.
